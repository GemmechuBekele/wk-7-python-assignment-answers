# Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

## 📘 Description

This project demonstrates how to load, explore, analyze, and visualize data using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**. The goal is to gain insights from a dataset through statistical analysis and visual representation.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Load and analyze a dataset using the `pandas` library.
- Visualize data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Present findings and patterns in a structured, insightful manner.

---

## 📂 Submission Contents

- ✅ `assignment.ipynb` – the Jupyter Notebook submission including:
  - Data loading and exploration
  - Basic data analysis
  - At least four visualizations
  - Observations and insights

---

## ✅ Tasks Overview

### 📌 Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

- Load a dataset (CSV recommended)
- View top rows using `.head()`
- Check data types and missing values
- Handle missing data appropriately (drop or fill)

### 📌 Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

- Use `.describe()` to get summary statistics
- Group and analyze categorical variables
- Identify patterns and insights

### 📌 Task 3: Data Visualization

Create **at least four** plots:
1. **Line chart** – trend over time
2. **Bar chart** – category comparison
3. **Histogram** – distribution of numerical values
4. **Scatter plot** – relationship between two numerical features

Enhance each with:
- Titles
- Axis labels
- Legends
- (Optional) Seaborn styling for visual appeal

## 🗃️ Dataset Suggestions

You may use:
- Public datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
- Built-in datasets like `load_iris()` from `sklearn.datasets`

---

## 🛠️ Error Handling

- Use `try-except` blocks for file loading or data conversion errors.
- Handle null or incorrectly formatted data gracefully.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure all plots are clearly labeled and explained.
- Include markdown cells in the notebook to describe your approach and observations.
- Submit only `assignment.ipynb` – ensure it runs top-to-bottom without errors.
